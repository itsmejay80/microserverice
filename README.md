# microserverice
This project demonstrates the power of microservices architecture, combining Python FastAPI for the backend, React for the frontend, RedisJSON as a NoSQL database, and Redis Streams as an event bus. Explore the seamless integration of these technologies to create a dynamic and event-driven application.

Features:
- Utilizes Python FastAPI to build robust and efficient microservices for data processing.
- Integrates React to create a responsive and user-friendly frontend.
- Utilizes RedisJSON, a NoSQL database, for storing and managing data in JSON format.
- Implements Redis Streams as an event bus to dispatch and handle events between microservices.
- Follows microservices best practices to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

Key Technologies:
- FastAPI: Python framework for building high-performance APIs with ease.
- React: JavaScript library for crafting interactive and engaging user interfaces.
- RedisJSON: NoSQL database to store and manage data in JSON format efficiently.
- Redis Streams: Event bus for handling events and enabling asynchronous communication between microservices.

Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Set up RedisJSON and Redis Streams according to the provided instructions.
3. Navigate to the microservices backend directory and run the FastAPI applications.
4. Navigate to the frontend directory and install project dependencies using npm.
5. Launch the frontend development server using npm to interact with the microservices.
